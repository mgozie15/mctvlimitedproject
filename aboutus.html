<h2>My Role in the Project</h2>
<p>Hey! I'm Michael (Roberta), and I played a key role in MCTV Limited's project. I was responsible for the Microsoft Access Database and the creation of these webpages. I also checked on each of my group members, making sure they done their part and documented this on the trello that I created as a part of this project aswell.</p>

<h2>Examples of My Work (screenshots provided below)</h2>
<p>At the bottom of the webpage, you can find screenshots of my gantt chart Trello board, which assisted me in keeping my weekly work in check. You can also find a screenshot of the MS Access Database I created, which included 4 tables, 2 queries and 4 forms.</p>

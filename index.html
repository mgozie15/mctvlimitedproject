            <h2>Details of the project!</h2>
            <p>This is the homepage for our project. It will showcase the details and requirements of your project.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Firstly, we had to read the case study about MCTV limited and read the instructions carefully. Each staff member had a different role.</li>
                <li>The 5 staff members were Derek, who manages sales and marketing, Roberts who aspires to be the financial controller, Mark and Liam, who pursue a computer science and electronics degree respectively, and John who's a part time shop assistant.</li>
                <li>The company is owned by Michael Cooney and his wife, Doreen. They're in their 60's and are unfamiliar with the technological side of business ownership these days.</li>
            </ul>

            <ol>
                <li>Each employee (group member) has their own responsibility for their area:</li>
                <li>There were multiple things which needed to be completed, including: A Project fact sheet, a MS Access Database, a Use Case Diagram, sharing the files through Github, a Trello to map the tasks, a WordPress website, and a maximum 10 minute presentation.</li>
